## 🌟 Core & Standout Features

- **Cross-Modal RL**: Integrates vision, audio, and text for advanced decision making.
- **Safe Self-Modification**: Dynamic hotpatching and ethics negotiation with cryptographic validation.
- **Hardware-Aware Training**: Adapts learning to hardware resources (SGX, GPU).
- **Threshold Cryptography**: Multi-signature and secure action gating for critical changes.
- **SGX-Enforced Isolation**: Trusted execution with Intel SGX for sensitive modules.
- **Dynamic Integrity & Rollback**: Runtime checksums and blockchain-based audit for safety.
- **Ethics-Aware RL**: Immutable core ruleset with enforced behavioral constraints.
