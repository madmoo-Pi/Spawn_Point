## Features

- **Cross-Modal RL:** Integrates vision, audio, and text for deep multimodal understanding via sensory fusion networks.
- **Safe Self-Modification:** Hotpatching and dynamic module synthesis, strictly checked by cryptographic and behavioral validators.
- **Hardware-Aware Training:** Adapts learning and resource use to hardware constraints, supporting Intel SGX enclaves for secure execution.
- **Immutable Ethics Core:** All self-changes are recorded in a blockchain-based ledger and require threshold cryptographic consent.
- **Plug-and-Play Drivers:** Modular architecture allows new sensors, effectors, and hardware with minimal integration friction.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Health checks, metrics export, and rollback capabilities provide robust fault-tolerance and auditability.

---

## Architecture Overview

The system is organized for **modularity, security, and extensibility**:

- **Reinforcement Learning:** Core RL uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with cross-modal fusion and reward shaping for robust policy learning across sensory domains.
- **Self-Modification:** The AI can synthesize and load new neural modules at runtime, subject to dynamic integrity checks and cryptographic approval.
- **Security:** All actions run in isolated containers (optionally hardware-backed by SGX), with runtime checksums and a rollback mechanism to ensure safe evolution.
- **Ethics:** Immutable rulesets and a cryptographically-audited blockchain ledger ensure all policy changes adhere to human-aligned ethics and can be externally audited.

## Core Components

### Cross-Modal RL

Implements sensory fusion and multimodal policy learning:

```python
fused_state = fusion_net(vision, audio, text)  # Multimodal embedding
```

### Safe Self-Modification

Dynamic module synthesis and hotpatching, validated by cryptography and runtime checks:

```python
if patch_system.validate(onnx_model):
    patch_system.apply_patch(onnx_model)
```

### Hardware-Aware Training

Adaptive resource use and batch sizing:

```python
batch_size = hw_monitor.adjust_batch_size()
```

### Threshold Cryptography

All critical changes require multi-party approval:

```python
if schnorr.verify(msg, [sig1, sig2, sig3]):
    apply_ethics_change()
```

---

## Safety & Security Mechanisms

1. **SGX-Enforced Isolation:**  
   All untrusted code runs inside secure enclaves:
   ```python
   with secure_container.IsolationEnclave():
       untrusted_driver.run()
   ```
2. **Dynamic Integrity Checks:**  
   Runtime checksums and rollback on anomaly:
   ```python
   if not checksum.validate(runtime_memory):
       trigger_rollback()
   ```
3. **Ethics-Aware RL:**  
   Rewards and actions cross-checked against immutable ethics core:
   ```python
   reward += ethics.validate(action) * 2.0
   ```

---

## Build & Run

1. **Build the container:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t conscious_ai . --build-arg ENV=production
   ```

2. **Run with hardware acceleration:**
   ```bash
   docker run --gpus all --device /dev/sgx/enclave -it conscious_ai
   ```

---

## Testing

Run integration and security tests:

```bash
pytest ci/test_integration.py -v
```

---

## Extensibility Guide

- **Adding a New Sensory Modality:**  
  - Extend `core/rl/cross_modal/fusion_net.py` with new input layers.
  - Update `reward_shaping.py` for new modality-specific rewards.

- **Supporting Custom Hardware:**  
  - Implement an adapter in `core/rl/hw_constrained.py`.
  - Create a new driver in `core/drivers/`.

- **Upgrading Cryptography:**  
  - Swap Schnorr for BLS signatures in `auth/`.
