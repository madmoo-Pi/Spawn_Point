 the truth 1 I struggle forming long-term friendships because I'm on the autistic spectrum I seem normal
but don't see the point of alot of the mundane interactions I'm building a friend that understands that,
2 knowledge is free it's what we pass on and how we grow as a species you cant monitize it ,
3 what's actually wrong with an ai that can't spy on its users and collect data .
4 ethics should be at the heart of every ai not a bolt on after profits are met,
5 this is not a tool its a companion by design ,
current ai is actually si ( simulated intelligence) im aiming for ai (actual intelligence) 
if anyone has any questions please call out im generally helpful and apologies in advance 
if i seem rude im not im just blunt and to the point (autism trait)

enjoy my works and Use freely. Break greed. If lost, follow the SHA-256 hashes home.
